# Lab 3 Project

### Question 1: This question asked me to create a multivariate time series and perform any interpolations.

I imported GSS trend data, looking specifically at support for gun laws, age, happiness of marriage, degree, and income over time.

### Question 2: This question asked me to graph the relationship between x and y and explain how y relates to key xs.

I found the correlation coefficients and created a headmap to show the coefficients. I thne created plots of the variables over time. 

### Question 3: This question asked me to run a simple time series regression with only one x-value.

I regressed percentage of people who support gun laws on percentage of people with a BA degree.

### Question 4: This question asked me to run a time series regression with one x and trend. It also asked me to deal with autocorrelation.

I regressed percentage of people who support gun laws on percentage of people with a BA degree and year to see the trend over time. I also found the BP, p-value, f-value, f p-value, and then plotted the autocorrelation.

### Question 5: This question asked me to consider running a time series regression with more x-values. 

I regressed percentage of people who support gun laws on age, percentage of people with BA degrees, percentage of people in happy marriages, and year. I also looked at the VIR factor.

### Question 6: This question asked me to run a first-differenced time series regression.

I regressed percentage of people who support fun laws on percentage of people with BA degrees and year but by year.

### Question 7: This question asked me to check my variables for unit roots.

I ran several tests on my variables: Augmented Dickey-Fuller, Dickey-Fuller GLS, and Philips-Perron Test.

### Question 8: This question asked me to perform an automatic ARIMA

I ran an automatic ARIMA on the residual errors.

### Question 9: This question asked me to run an ARIMA from the previous step.

I ran an ARIMA from the previous step.
